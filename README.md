# bamazon

Welcome to bamazon!

An Amazon-esque CLI app that illustrates the functions of checking stock inventory so customers are able to purchase the product quantity they would like. If customers would like to continue shopping, there will be an option at the end of their transaction. 

To use bamazon, 

1. Enter **node bamazonCustomer.js** into the command-line terminal.
2. The app will populate the terminal with a welcome message and the products available on bamazon.
3. User will be prompted to enter an **item_id** number of the specific product they are interested in.
4. Then, user will be prompted to enter the quantity of how many items they would like.
5. From there, the bamazon will respond with a specific message for if the transaction was successful or if there is an insufficient quantity.
6. If the user buys the last item in stock, a message will appear stating that bamazon is out of stock for that item.
7. Lastly, bamazon will ask if the user would like to continue shopping. If yes, the terminal will re-populate with the bamazon product menu.
